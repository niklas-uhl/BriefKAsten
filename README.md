Asynchronous (buffering) MPI message queue implementation ðŸ“¬

This has been developed as part of our work on [distributed triangle counting](https://github.com/niklas-uhl/katric).

## Usage
This library is header only. You need a C++ 20 ready compiler (tested with GCC11-GCC13).

To use it in your project, include this repo using `FetchContent`, as `git submodule` or your preferred way of CMake dependency management and (if needed) include it as subdirectory[^1] . You can link against it using

``` cmake
# if using git submodules
add_subdirectory(path/to/submodule)

# if using FetchContent
FetchContent_Declare(message-queue
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/niklas-uhl/message-queue
  GIT_TAG main # or current commit
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(message-queue)

# using CPM (recommended)
CPMAddPackage("gh:niklas-uhl/message-queue#master")  # or current commit

# link against the target
target_link_libraries(<your-target> PRIVATE message-queue::message-queue)
```

You most likely want to use the most current implementation with buffering enabled. To do so, include `message-queue/buffered_queue.hpp`. For a usage example, see `message_buffering_example.cpp`.

## Caveats
This library relies heavily on C++ concepts and the ranges library. Especially
the latter is not fully supported by all compilers claiming to support C++20. If
you use a splitter function using `std::ranges::split_view`, you should be aware
that some older compilers (< GCC 12 || < Clang 16) do not return a
`std::ranges::sized_range` when splitting a sized ranged (such as message
buffers), which is required for all messages used with the message queue. This
behavior has been described in [P2210R2](https://wg21.link/P2210R2) and fixed in
the current version of the standard. `std::ranges::split_view` now returns
subranges which have the same iterator type as the underlying view, while the
old behavior has been renamed to `std::ranges::lazy_split_view`. If you use a
compiler without this defect fixed, you have to manually convert the returned
lazy split view to a sized split view. See
[`examples/indirection_example.cpp`](./examples/indirection_example.cpp).
 

[^1]: Note that this project itself uses [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for its dependencies. By default, this requires an internet connection during CMake's configure step, which may not be feasible if your system is behind a firewall. In this case, configure the project locally with the cache variable `CPM_SOURCE_CACHE` set to a location where to download the dependencies. You can then transfer this directory to the remote machine and use it at as a source cache there.
